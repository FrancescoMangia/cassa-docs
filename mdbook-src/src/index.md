# Cassa Protocol Documentation

Welcome to the Cassa Protocol documentation!

## What is Cassa?

Cassa is a fully deterministic onchain insurance layer that turns risk into liquid, tradable markets. Every policy is enforced algorithmically (no governance, no human arbiters), and risk is priced continuously through an AMM, enabling streaming payouts, secondary-market trading, and real-time hedging for vaults, lenders, stakers and stablecoin issuers.
